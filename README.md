My everyday coding experience
This will be my first time coding and not gonna lie to you i'm having many difficulties and i know its shameful for me to say this but i am the worse at programming and especially when it comes to installing some new application for the first time. Like seriously i need some serious help, so please go easy on me to whoever is reading this.
